# CreditFraudDetection
This ML project is about detection of Credit Card fraud transactions.
1. Here we are using the dataset which is already PCA transformed expect Amount and Time column.
2. Project explains the concept of dealing with unbalanced dataset.
3. I have used the concept of  Oversampling to deal with Unbalanced dataset.
4. Credit fraud is a classification problem, I have used different Algorithms such as SVC,KNN,Logistic Regression,Decision tree.
5. Used ROC and AUC concept to select the best performing model for fraud detection.

#Credits
I would like to thank janio bachmann for the dataset and detail explaination on dealing of Unbalanced dataset.
